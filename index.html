        <h1>Navigating Technology for Visually Impaired Users</h1>
        <h2>Visually Impaired in the Digital World</h2>
        <p>As tech professionals, it is important to look at content and interfaces you create from other  perspectives. Some experts argue that interface creators will never fully understand whether their interfaces are usable or not. This is why an entire field was created solely for user tests and studies. As technology continues its rapid growth, the importance of usability and accessibility continues to be as important as ever. Most people rely on looking at a screen for daily life, how does this affect individuals who can’t see the screen or certain elements on it?  
		<br>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines vision impairment as a person either having diminished vision acuity at a distance, which can range from mild to blind, or severely diminished near vision acuity. The WHO reports that at least 2.2 billion people are classified as visually impaired in the world. 
		<br>As such a large group of people live without the privilege of sight, it is important that technology is created and designed in a way that  all users can enjoy and benefit from. Technology which has been created for these users has kept pace with  the rest of the digital worlds. Many page structures and layouts on the web are not compatible with the technology which is available for visually impaired users. It is imperative that interfaces should be created with accessibility for blind users and visually impared in mind. 
        <br>The following topics cover several important ideas and topics to keep in mind when designing interfaces and creating content for blind and visually impared users.
