        <h2>Smartphones and the accessibility</h2>

        <p>Unlike people with normal vision who interact with smartphones, tablets, and computers using their eyes, blind users are believed to have difficulties in using those devices, or seem to be cut off from these technologies. However, as technology has evolved, companies are taking people with vision disability into account and providing many accessibility tweaks and software that enable blind users to navigate websites and use apps. 
            <p>Wondering how blind people actually use a smartphone? Here is an example:

        <h2>Built In Accessibility Options</h2>

        <p>The first and foremost function that comes with smartphones nowadays is the built-in accessibility feature. Both Apple and Android devices provide blind users the support they need. On Apple products, VoiceOver is the mentioned feature. This feature reads the content of a smartphone’s screen out loud, along with vibration; allows users to browse apps, open links, type texts and emails, almost everything. Similar feature on Android devices also work pretty much the same way. </p>

        <h3>Apple's Accessibility Features</h3>

        <p>Nowadays, VoiceOver is considered one of the best accessibility feature in the market. This technology is available on many Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AppleTV, HomePod, iPod touch). VoiceOver is updated to be able to describe people, objects, text, and graphs in greater detail. If users prefer using a physical keyboard, it can be connected wirelessly via Bluetooth (only for Bluetooth keyboard), or via cable on Mac series. Currently, VoiceOver is speaking over <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206175#:~:text=VoiceOver%20includes%20built%2Din%20voices%20that%20speak%20over%2030%20languages.">30 languages</a>.</p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/">Accessibility Shortcut</a> also supports low vision users by allowing them to easily add, organize, and customize shortcuts for the tools and settings, or add magnifier, text size in order to adjust text size. In addition to all that, Audio Descriptions is one more useful function where blind users can watch movies with detailed audio descriptions of every scene. </p>

        <h3>Android's Accessibility Features</h3>

        <p>The built-in technology TalkBack owned by Google, as mentioned before, has very similar functionalities like VoiceOver. However, the feature supports <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/11101402?hl=en&ref_topic=10601571">63 languages</a>, a lot more than VoiceOver. 
            Moreover, users are also able to customize their device with accessibility settings and apps, just like on Apple devices. There are a few interaction controls including Lookout (provide visually impaired or low vision users information about their surroundings), Voice Access (control with spoken commands), Switch Access (interact using switch(es) or keyboard), Action Blocks (customized buttons for routine actions). For audio justification, Sound Amplifier enables users to use wired or Bluetooth headphones to control the sounds in their environment; or Hearing aid support allows users to pair hearing aids to hear more clearly. Many more accessibility features are available on <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en#:~:text=Download%20Android%20Accessibility%20Suite%2C%20which,ways%20to%20customize%20your%20device.">Android Accessibility Suite</a>. </p>
