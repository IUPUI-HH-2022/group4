        <h2>Other Assistive Technology For The Blind</h2>

        <p>This section will be talking about products that are upcoming, delayed, and out already. There are five different technologies that this section will talk about. </p>

        <h5>How Ara is supposed to be worn by the user</h5>

        <h2>The Ara:</h2>

        <p>This is a device which helps visually impaired and blind people. It is a system which uses haptic feed-back to warn its wearer about obstacles in front of them. It has lenses which look up, down, left, and right to accomplish this. It also can be used for directional navigations so that one does not veer off course.</p>  

        <p> Ara is an upcoming device which could be very useful if the underlying hardware and software delivers a solution which actually fulfills this scope. This is because this device could help its users access new and unfamiliar spaces by reducing reliance on other people or having to employ the use of canes which is more limited in the range at which a user can detect objects. This device is projected to cost around $500 dollars and will come out in 2022.</p>

        <h5>This is what the back of the Xbox Braille Controller will look like</h5>

        <h2>Xbox Braille Controller:</h2>

        <p>This is still emerging technology, and as such there is currently not much information available. What has been released is a schematic of the controller which overall mirrors a standard controller with the addition on the back of paddles for multifunction input. These are speculated to perhaps be related to prompts or other inputs needed. The panel in the back will also be able to translate on screen text into braille, so that the player can read text on their screen. There is currently no release date and no price announced but this is speculated to release in the next few years.  </p>

        <h5>Finger Reader Prototype 1</h5>

        <h5>Finger Reader Prototype 2</h5>

        <h2>The Finger Reader (Name Is A Work In Process):</h2>

        <p>This technology allows for new ways for blind users to interact with their world. For example, this ring can read printed text so visually impaired or blind people can read print books without waiting for them to be translated into braille. It can also be used to read other items like money, checks, and signs. This ring would enable visually impaired or blind people to have more access to the worlds where braille is largely unavailable. </p>
            
        <p>Unfortunately, there has been little progress on this tech. First revealed around 2013, like many emerging technologies it made the rounds in the world of accessibility and technology for the visually impaired, but after 2016 there has not been any further updates. The main issues with the technology were that the software was slow, it could not read fonts smaller than 12 pt, and the voice it read the text aloud with was not good. It also required a constant connection to a power supply and a phone. However, the people making this device were able to work out some of the device's defects and made it smaller, having a watch-like object that powers it. There is no release date or price as of this writing </p>

        <h2>Screen Readers:</h2>

        <p>This tech is not new and has continued to get better each year. One of the most used screen readers is JAWS. People have created ways to use this screen reader in other applications, like video games. This allows people to play games which were previously unplayable by them due to needing visuals, now that they can access them with a screen reader. The prices vary depending on which screen reader is used and what supplemental technology they need in addition to the screen reader. </p>

        <h2>VoiceAttack</h2>

        <p>This technology uses your voice to access files and programs on your computer. This software can be used with many different applications, for example: Word, Steam, or Chrome. It listens to what you are saying, and then uses speech to text to interpret your commands, and then runs them. It can also be used in virtual reality. VoiceAttack, in combination with a screen reader, could make using a computer even faster for blind and visually impaired users.
